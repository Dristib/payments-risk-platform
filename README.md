# Payments Platform — Product & Systems Design

This repository contains end-to-end product documentation for a modern,
API first payments platform.

The goal is not feature ideation, but **system-level product thinking**
covering reliability, risk, operations, and financial correctness at scale.

This repo is structured to resemble internal product documentation used by
payments and fintech platform teams.

1. Checkout & payment orchestration
2. Refunds and reconciliation
3. Fraud and risk scoring
4. Chargebacks and dispute management
5. Multi tenant admin and access control
6. Incident response and platform safety
