# Rules vs ML in Risk Scoring

## Rules Based Systems
- High explainability
- Deterministic behavior
- Faster iteration

## ML-Based Systems
- Adaptive to evolving fraud
- Higher ceiling on detection
- Increased opacity

---

## Decision

Phase 1:
- Rules based engine with weighted signals

Phase 2:
- ML assisted scoring in shadow mode

Explainability and safety are prioritized over raw detection power.
